Platform Requirements
The website should be built using one of the following platforms:

Replit: For custom-built websites with backend integration, perfect for connecting to APIs or building custom logic.

Lovable: For a simple, no-code approach if the focus is on quick deployment and easy management.

Windsurf: For building websites with a focus on modern UI/UX and customizable design.

Cursor: To build a code-first solution with collaboration features if advanced customization is required.

Additional Requirements
Analytics: Google Analytics integration to monitor performance metrics (user sessions, conversion rates, bounce rates).

Responsive Design: The website must be fully responsive across all devices (desktop, mobile, tablet).

SEO Optimization: Implement SEO best practices, including semantic HTML, image optimization, and clean URLs.

Content Management System: Ensure that all content (including product details, resources, and case studies) can be easily updated from the backend.

Assumptions and Considerations
ERP Integration: Although the ERP integration is not fully defined, the website should be built with flexibility to integrate with an ERP system once it is determined.

Multi-Language: Start with English and one other language (e.g., Spanish or French), with the potential for more languages as needed.

Hosting and Deployment: Choose a platform that provides scalable hosting solutions to support future growth in traffic and content updates.
